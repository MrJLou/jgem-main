# Authentication Token Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
You were experiencing token authentication issues between devices because **two different authentication systems were running simultaneously**, causing conflicts:

1. **AuthenticationManager** with **EnhancedUserTokenService** (new system)
2. **AuthService** (old system)

### What Was Happening:
- Login used `AuthenticationManager.login()` (new system) to authenticate
- But then called `AuthService.saveLoginCredentials()` (old system) to save credentials
- The two systems used different storage mechanisms:
  - New system: `SharedPreferences` with keys like `current_session_token`
  - Old system: `FlutterSecureStorage` with keys like `auth_token`
- Session validation failed because it looked for tokens in the wrong storage location

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated Login Screen (`lib/screens/login_screen.dart`)
- âœ… Removed duplicate `AuthService.saveLoginCredentials()` calls
- âœ… Now uses only `AuthenticationManager.login()` for authentication
- âœ… Credentials are automatically saved by the new system
- âœ… Added proper session conflict handling

### 2. Updated Auth Screen (`lib/screens/auth_screen.dart`)
- âœ… Replaced `AuthService.isLoggedIn()` with `AuthenticationManager.isLoggedIn()`
- âœ… Replaced `AuthService.getSavedCredentials()` with `AuthenticationManager.getCurrentUserAccessLevel()`
- âœ… Updated login flow to use `AuthenticationManager.login()`
- âœ… Added session conflict dialog for force logout
- âœ… Removed unused imports (AuthService, ApiService)

### 3. Updated Main App (`lib/main.dart`)
- âœ… Added import for `AuthenticationManager`
- âœ… Changed auth check from `AuthService.isLoggedIn()` to `AuthenticationManager.isLoggedIn()`

### 4. System Consolidation
- âœ… Eliminated conflicting token storage systems
- âœ… Ensured single source of truth for authentication state
- âœ… Fixed token validation across devices

## How It Works Now

### Login Flow:
1. User enters credentials
2. `AuthenticationManager.login()` authenticates and checks for existing sessions
3. If user already logged in elsewhere: Shows conflict dialog
4. User can choose to force logout other devices
5. Session token is created and stored consistently
6. All devices use the same token validation system

### Session Management:
- âœ… Only one device can be logged in per user account
- âœ… Session tokens are stored in `SharedPreferences` consistently
- âœ… Token validation works across all devices
- âœ… Automatic session monitoring and cleanup
- âœ… Real-time notifications when logged out from another device

### Device Synchronization:
- âœ… WebSocket broadcasting of session changes
- âœ… Automatic logout notifications across devices
- âœ… Database sync of session state changes

## Expected Behavior Now

### Scenario 1: Normal Login
1. User logs in on Device A âœ…
2. Session token created and stored âœ…
3. User can access all features âœ…

### Scenario 2: Second Device Login
1. User tries to login on Device B âœ…
2. System detects existing session on Device A âœ…
3. Shows "Account Already Active" dialog âœ…
4. User chooses "Force Login" âœ…
5. Device A gets logout notification and redirects to login âœ…
6. Device B completes login successfully âœ…

### Scenario 3: Token Validation
1. App startup checks session validity âœ…
2. Invalid/expired tokens automatically trigger logout âœ…
3. Session monitoring runs every 5 minutes âœ…
4. Consistent token validation across all devices âœ…

## Files Modified
- `lib/screens/login_screen.dart` - Fixed duplicate auth system calls
- `lib/screens/auth_screen.dart` - Migrated to new auth system
- `lib/main.dart` - Updated auth check to use new system

## Testing
Run the test script to verify the fixes:
```bash
dart test_auth_fix.dart
```

## Result
ðŸŽ¯ **Your token authentication should now work properly across devices!**

The conflicting authentication systems have been consolidated, and tokens will be validated consistently across all devices. Users will be properly notified when their session conflicts occur, and the force logout functionality will work as expected.
