# Doctor Schedule System - Removed

## Overview
The doctor schedule system has been completely removed from the application. Doctor work schedules are now managed directly through the User model during user registration.

## What Was Removed
- All separate doctor schedule models and services
- Doctor work schedule screens
- Complex scheduling systems
- Separate database tables for doctor schedules

## Current Implementation
Doctor availability is now handled entirely through the User model:
- Working days are set during doctor registration
- Arrival and departure times are stored in the User model
- The dashboard displays this information directly from user data
- Only doctors with working days selected for the current day appear in the dashboard

## Key Changes Made
1. **Removed Files**:
   - `lib/models/doctor_schedule.dart`
   - `lib/models/doctor_work_schedule.dart` 
   - `lib/services/doctor_schedule_service.dart`
   - `lib/services/doctor_work_schedule_service.dart`
   - `lib/screens/appointments/doctor_work_schedule_screen.dart`

2. **Updated Files**:
   - `lib/widgets/dashboard/dashboard_doctors_section.dart` - Now uses User model directly
   - `lib/main.dart` - Removed doctor schedule routes
   - User registration system already handles doctor schedule during registration

3. **Database Cleanup**:
   - Doctor schedule tables are no longer used
   - All schedule data comes from the users table

## Current Dashboard Behavior
- Shows only doctors working today (based on their selected working days)
- Displays their work hours from User model fields
- Shows availability status based on current time vs their work hours
- If a doctor didn't select a specific day, they won't appear in the UI for that day

This simplified approach eliminates duplicate systems and consolidates all doctor information in the User model where it's set during registration.
