# User Interface Updates - Version 2.1

This document outlines recent improvements to the J-Gem Medical and Diagnostic Clinic system.

## 1. Patient Registration Date Picker Enhancement

### What Changed
The date of birth picker in patient registration has been improved to provide better user experience.

### Previous Behavior
- Users could only select dates up to the current month within the allowed year
- Limited selection within the year (e.g., only January to July in 2020)

### New Behavior
- Users can now select any date within the entire allowed year
- Full year selection available (January 1st to December 31st of valid years)
- The date picker starts at January 1st of the oldest allowed year (5 years ago)
- Age restriction of 5 years minimum is still enforced during validation

### Technical Details
- **File**: `lib/screens/registration/patient_registration_screen.dart`
- **Change**: Modified `initialDate` to be January 1st of the 5-years-ago year
- **Change**: Set `lastDate` to December 31st of the 5-years-ago year
- **Validation**: Age validation still prevents registration of patients under 5 years old

### User Impact
- More intuitive date selection
- Users can register patients born in any month of valid years
- Reduced confusion when selecting birth dates

## 2. Laboratory Results Duplicate Filtering

### What Changed
The laboratory results display system now intelligently handles duplicate entries to show only meaningful data.

### Previous Behavior
- Both payment placeholder records ("Laboratory Only") and actual lab results ("Unknown Doctor") were displayed
- Users saw confusing duplicate entries
- Difficulty identifying which records contained actual test values

### New Behavior
- Only records with actual laboratory values are displayed (now labeled "LAB-ONLY")
- Payment placeholder records ("Laboratory Only") are automatically filtered out
- Clean, unambiguous display of laboratory data
- Consistent labeling throughout the system

### Technical Details
- **File**: `lib/screens/laboratory/previous_laboratory_results_screen.dart`
- **Change**: Updated deduplication logic to prioritize "LAB-ONLY" records
- **Change**: Renamed "Unknown Doctor" to "LAB-ONLY" for clarity
- **Change**: Filter out "Laboratory Only" payment records in all views
- **Change**: Applied same logic to lab history dialogs

### Affected Areas
1. **Previous Laboratory Results Screen**
   - Main results list
   - Lab history dialog
   - Search and filtering

2. **Patient Records**
   - Laboratory results section
   - Historical data display

### User Impact
- Eliminates confusion from duplicate laboratory entries
- Cleaner, more professional interface
- Faster identification of actual test results
- Improved workflow efficiency for medical staff

## 3. User Manual Updates

### Changes Made
The system's built-in PDF manual has been updated to reflect these improvements:

1. **Patient Registration Section (4.1)**
   - Added explanation of enhanced date picker functionality
   - Clarified age restrictions and date selection capabilities

2. **Patient Records Section (4.3)**
   - Updated laboratory results description to mention duplicate filtering
   - Explained "LAB-ONLY" labeling system

3. **FAQ Section (7)**
   - Added FAQ about laboratory result filtering
   - Added FAQ about date picker limitations

### Accessing the Manual
